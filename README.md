## Social issues in cities through urban social networks

**Supervisor:** Sándor Juhász

**Short description:**
This thesis investigates geolocated social networks in U.S. metropolitan areas to uncover how urban social structures reflect and reinforce social issues such as inequality, segregation, and unequal access to opportunities. Using spatially embedded network data, the project aims to provide quantitative insights that can inform urban planning, mobility policies, and neighborhood well-being.

**Research questions/Tasks/Topics:** <br>
* Do network-based communities correspond to spatially segregated neighborhoods defined by infrastructure or historical boundaries?<br>
* How do racial and income inequalities manifest in urban social networks?<br>
* How does the diversity of individuals’ social connections relate to income or social mobility at the neighborhood level?<br>
* Does the structure of urban social networks differ systematically across cities with different levels of inequality or segregation?<br>
* Are opportunity-rich areas more interconnected within cities?<br>
* Can network measures predict resilience or vulnerability of neighborhoods to social or economic shocks?
